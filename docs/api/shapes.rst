the collections that contain them.

|AdjustmentCollection| objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An AutoShape is distinctive in that it can have *adjustments*, represented in
the PowerPoint user interface as small yellow diamonds that each allow
a parameter of the shape, such as the angle of an arrowhead, to be adjusted.
The |AdjustmentCollection| object holds these adjustment values for an
AutoShape, each of which is an |Adjustment| instance.

The |AdjustmentCollection| instance for an AutoShape is accessed using the
``Shape.adjustments`` property (read-only).
